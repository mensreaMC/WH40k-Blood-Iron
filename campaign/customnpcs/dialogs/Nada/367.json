    "DialogText": "The heretic communities grew in numbers and strength. More and more of the population turned to religion during the war, and many of the new believers drifted to the cults that had sprung up everywhere. People started to talk about the communities, and word was that some carried out ritual murder, human sacrifice, and worse. On top of all that, refugees fleeing the war ravaged cities began seeking shelter where they could find it, driving some into the hands of the cults whose desert compounds had remained untouched by the war. This was also the time when the artifacts started appearing. Prospectors, archaeologists and looters had only begun to pry through Mortua's past before the war, and that was due to regulations. Once it all kicked off the least of anyone's concern was prosecuting grave robbers. These things were creepy as hell, and they seemed to be everywhere. I think those damn things drove a lot of good people mad, but I can't prove it.",
