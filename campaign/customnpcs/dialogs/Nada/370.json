Even repeating some of the names, the phrases..it makes my head hurt. Hell, I can feel the backs of my eyes burning just remembering the things I've seen them do, those rituals, all those people they killed for no reason. That star, the one with the arrows pointing outwards like spokes on a wheel, it means something to them, and they put it on everything they build. I'm sure you've seen it before, but it's not just some harmless design, it's got a power of its own. They all talk in your ear about this \"Primordial Truth\" of theirs, too. Some kind of set of beliefs about how the universe is dominated by Chaos, and how Chaos inevitably triumphs, so why not embrace it now? That sort of thing. It's all bullshit. I may not be a pious person, but I know bullshit when I see it, and even if it's all true, nothing good will come of it. Not at all... Anyhow, I think I've said enough, too much maybe.
