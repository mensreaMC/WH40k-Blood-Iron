Some, I'm sure, didn't have a choice in the matter, but many were willing to fight just for the thrill of killing. Her entourage's murky reputation also seemed to be a big draw; no one has seen many of them with their helmets off in a long time, and it's hard to shake the feeling that somethings amiss with them. Finally, once those beasts started appearing the cultists became zealous in their view of Burke as some kind of figurehead in their religion, attributing the beasts convenient appearance to some favor the dark gods bestowed upon her. Even today they still come just to be near her, and now that she's come out of hiding it'll be much worse. I only hope she doesn't empower them more than she has, else another, smaller civil war will break out right here, among her own ranks. It will not be pretty.",
