Those that stood with Burke became corrupted over time, I don't know by who. The others were part of the outcasts of society, even before the civil war. They lived in remote communities and dabbled in bullshit that would have got them hanged on any civilized world. They got away with it on Mortua because of Burke's lackadaisical oversight. I ask myself if she didn't know all along and allow them to fester. Now they crawl here, this is their holy city, with Burke as their de-facto leader.",
