She's currently overseeing the grand opening of the blood bowl, we built it ages ago but never had her around to get it started up properly. Blood bowl's on level three of the vault, so I'll have to guide you there if it's your first time visiting it. Before you go, talk to the guy to my right. He's the general of our surface forces and he has a mission for you. Oh, I almost forgot to mention it: Drucilla asked to speak with you. She's that morose old woman who sells books right above the market; can't miss her. So, take care of what you need to do here and then talk to me when you're ready to meet Burke.",
