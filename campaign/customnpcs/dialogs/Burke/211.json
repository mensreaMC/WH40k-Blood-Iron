Any other time the Ad-mech would handle such a task, but the High Lords themselves chose to exclude most elements of the Mechanicus from this mission...save a few known for their more radical views. You see, there was much trepidation concerning the technology here. Initial reports showed promise, but more cautious elements warned of solemn lessons: The Men of Iron, Bloodtide and Chaos-tainted artifacts. We have learned enough of dangerous archeotech and the High Lords were keen to remember.",
