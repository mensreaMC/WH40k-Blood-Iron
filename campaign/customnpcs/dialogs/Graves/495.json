However, I cannot risk the damage that would be wrought should the existence of Chaos become known, and so I regretfully must wipe your mind of this incident. It will be as if you had never learned the truth about this case, discovered the daemon, or talked to me. This is for your own good as much as the galaxies, of course, so I know you understand. When the times come, though, this will all come back to you. You will remember not just the truth of Chaos, but of your latent abilities as well. When you remember, you will know what to do. My only hope is that it is the right.",
