The cult was nearing a pivotal point; the victims weren't merely playthings to the killers, they were sacrifices. They intended to open a portal to bring forth untold numbers of daemons. Had that happened this planet and all the souls on it would have been cleansed by the orbital weaponry of the Inquisition, if they were lucky. It was only through your hard work, diligence and natural talent that an entire world was spared the horrors of Chaos, and the subsequent Exterminatus that would have befallen it.",
