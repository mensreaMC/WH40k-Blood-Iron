No, but seriously, I just make records and play them. It's easy, but kind of a pain. First, you have to download a song. Try finding one you like on Youtube then ripping it with a site like http://www.youtube-mp3.org. Save it as an mp3 and then upload it to dropbox, mediafire or whatever ya' got. Once you do that just check out this record etcher, insert a blank record, and paste the link to the mp3 you're hosting. It'll then copy to the record which you gotta pop in an open record player. Yeah, open, you know? Open with your hand...no you can't open it with stuff in your hand. There? Good. Once it's in there it'll start to play. Also, you can combine up to nine records in a crafting grid to make a multirecord. Make me a mixtape, der kommissar.",
