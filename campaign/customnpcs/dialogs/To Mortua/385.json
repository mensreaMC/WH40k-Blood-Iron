-If you're tired of fending off mobs you can invest in turrets, tesla coils or even mercenaries to keep them at bay.

-Two quest hubs are located in areas where mobs don't spawn. There are some spots in those locations where you could build a base.

-Many NPC's can give you information that may be valuable. Try talking to them as much as possible.-Don't assume you know recipes. Many of the have been changed, including mod recipes.-There are two different locations for tracking quests. NPC mod quests are tracked through the quest tab in your inventory. HQM quests are tracked in your cogitator. Keep an eye on both for updates.",
