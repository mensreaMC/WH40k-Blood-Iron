-There are many different biomes to explore, some more dangerous than others.

-You can fill barrels with water and then carry the barrels with you.

-Animals can be found in Jungles, Mushroom Forests and sinkholes.

-Keep an eye out for resource biomes: small biomes with tremendous amounts of a certain type of resource. The resource in question occurs on the surface in small quantities.

-The volcano to the northeast goes down to a large lava reservoir and would be ideal for geothermal power.

-There is a very large deposit of pitchblende (uranium) on the map. A quest can lead you there.

-You don't HAVE to tech up or build machines. Raiding, mining and manufacturing certain things (booze, drugs) can net you enough credits to buy all the guns, ammo and armor you need.

-Completing missions for factions is a great way to make money and get the endgame weapons/armor. You can get many things through quests that you cannot make on your own.",
