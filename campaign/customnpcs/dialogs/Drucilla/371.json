It's an ancient Mortuan bible of sorts, and they gave it a name no sane person ought to ever pronounce. We in the business merely refer to it as the Book of Passage, and there is a good deal of controversy surrounding it. Speculation includes an outlandish theory that no two copies of the Book are the same, and there are at least three copies that I know of. Where the theory veers into conspiratorial territory is when it posits that the original, and only the original, contains verses of great power, words that can bring forth cosmic horrors, or grant the invoker abilities that are too absurd to humor.",
