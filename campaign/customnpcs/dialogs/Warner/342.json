They congregate in groups and spend most of their time howling at the walls, keeping me awake [Warner tenses up]. Honestly, if I had my way I'd cut the lot of them down just to get a decent nights sleep. Only downside is they provide most of the labor for the raids. Bastards are so crazy they prefer shitty swords and cleavers over guns, but damn if they ain't good with them. Sure ain't no shortage of slaves.",
