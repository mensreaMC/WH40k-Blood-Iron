This place...this place called to me, and in my desperation I sought it out. It was my destiny to come here, as it was yours. We have been drawn here by forces beyond our reckoning, for one purpose or another. I contacted you only because you wanted me to, and so our minds aligned, meeting on some misty, intangible plane..with this place acting like a conduit. You are uneasy now, and you have many questions, but they cannot be easily answered. You must come to the realization yourself, or all explanations will just be wind on your ears.",
