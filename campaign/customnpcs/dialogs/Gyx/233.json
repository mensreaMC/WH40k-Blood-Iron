Seeker, you have been adrift on an ocean of consciousness, barely grazing the surface of the great fathomless dark beneath. Your ignorance, a flimsy shield...it no longer protects you. Fear now consumes you, and madness follows. Behold, seeker...[the prophet makes a gesture with his hands]...the antidote for your fear, the light in the darkness, the strength of knowledge! It is why you are here, why you came to me. I will show you, and you will not want for safety again. You will find all you desire within yourself, and your power will become greater than the sum of your parts.",
