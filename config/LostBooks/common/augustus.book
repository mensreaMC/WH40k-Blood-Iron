Ma,
---
This morning some soldiers showed up at the farm and said that pa ought to come outside to talk. He came out and told me to get in the house and I heard some yelling and pa sounded mad. Then I heard some shooting and I ran outside.
The soldiers killed pa and they would have killed me but I got them first. Now they are looking for me and calling me a traitor but since everything has gone to hell I guess it doesn't matter anymore.
If you find this please head to the water pump, me and the boys are meeting up there and making a stand. If I don't see you again, remember I love you, and by the Emperor, don't let them catch you.
