Dysons Shit
 
Got my 50th kill today. Idiots just walking alone out in the wasteland, must have got drunk and went to take a piss and got lost. Plunked him right in the head but not before he caught a glimmer of the scope. 
I still dont understand why were gonna be making ammo now. They got me loading empties for hours on end while Oz stands over there, just churning out brass. I hid the bastards boots in the nitrocellulose, maybe he'll understand.
Gonna be going out soon, something big. I think we're going after Fort Dude, gonna bring down those damn guns. If it works, great, this entire valley is free from that firebase. If not, we're all dead.
