Command Log
 
been here for months and still no orders other than to harass the OF. only a matter of time before those bastards figure out where we are and aim the guns on us. if we can get some machinery maybe we can make some ammo of our own.
got some machines but working thems another story. very tedious stuff, the troops are getting restless doing this shit. their warriors, not factory workers. still cant find my damn boots, either.
order finally came in today, we're attacking that firebase tonight and one way or another fort dude will fall. we've got plenty of supplies thanks to our efforts, more than we can carry. we'll take what we can and leave the rest
may the Emperor protect us
