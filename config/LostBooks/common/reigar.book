If you somehow make it back from the wasteland and find us missing, check the caverns. Father Augustus is taking us in there to shelter from these monsters, and he says he can keep us safe from them forever.
I don't know what his plan is but at this point I don't care. I just can't stand the thought of getting ripped up by one of these monsters. The only thing I trust less than him is them.
I don't know why you left or what got into you but I don't care. I just want you back. Please come back.
