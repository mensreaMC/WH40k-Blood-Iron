Fourth Missing Page

The page is worn, but you can clearly make out an illustration with some indiscernible writing scrawled beneath it.
The picture on the page depicts a fool standing before a maze. The fool seems to be crippled, and is leaning on a crutch.
Aside the fool on the ground lay three dice. They read "666".
