ATTENTION PVT.RICKY ALVAREZ
---
Ricky me and Bubs are getting the hell off this planet. Burke has gone insane and is running this place into the ground fast. Meet us at the spaceport. I think I can still use my clearance code to grab us a Valk.
If you can't make it there or some asshat jacked all the vehicles then meet us at X.202 Z.200 Y.70. There's an Admech bunker there and you know those cyborg guys probably have all kinds of sweet gear.
I bribed some Lootenant guy with a couple packs of smokes to get the entrance code, it's 8219.
