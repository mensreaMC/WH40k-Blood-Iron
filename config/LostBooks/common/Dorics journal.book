strangest thing happened yesterday. all the workers were crowded around the bosses house. we had heard enough about the reservoir being poisoned and we werent too pleased about our pals being run out of town
and we were fixing to do something of it. so the boss steps out right in front of all of us like he got nothing to fear. says were sinking a new tunnel today. says he got good evidence we been missing
the motherlode this whole time. we agreed for one last time and i cant think of why but we did it. we sunk a new tunnel faster than we ever had before.
right at the end of the workday as we was getting restless and tired that kid Kinny starts drilling into wall. pulls his drill out peeks in and sees pitchblende staring back at him.
by the Emperor we were at it all night and we could not dig our way through that deposit. theres enough uranium in that lode to make the town rich. we kept at it all night and into the day.
now i ought to be dead tired but i cant go to sleep. been up working hard 2 days now and no chems in me. still thinking of what im gonna do with my cut i guess.
