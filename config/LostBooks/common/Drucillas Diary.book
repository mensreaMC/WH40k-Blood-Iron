Drucillas PRIVATE DIARY
 
Mom brought us to this little slice of hell to get a piece of the water action. I didn't want to come, I knew it was a bad place then, and every day I wonder if i'll ever get out of here.
It started when a crowd of people gathered outside the bosses house. They demanded to speak to him and so the boss let a few foreman in to talk. When they came out they all stood there
and explained the water was poison, that they tested it and found strange bacterias in it and until they had a scientist come in no one could pump it or drink it.
So a lot of people left but some stayed, and one group of people actually broke into the cave at night, and afterward no one heard from them again, they only knew they broke in cause they were
missing and the locks on the elevator were cut. Mom said they probably just got beat up by the bosses men and kicked out of town. She said they deserved it if they was that dumb.
I just wanted to scream, because Vardis was with them men, and I just know he wouldn't leave without me. I can't say nothing to mom but I think those men are dead, and I'm scared I'm next.
