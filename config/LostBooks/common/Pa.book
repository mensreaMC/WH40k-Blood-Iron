its been nearly a week since we got here and to spite the water sittin there under us that foreman aint havin no thought a pumpin it up.
town was almost dead and promise of water got men coming in from all around to get a piece of the pie yet these fools hold out.
damn bastards keep the place locked down now. wont let nobody in but bosses pals.
im not sure what the jig is but a few of us got a mind to go down and run some pumps our own when the towns asleep.
iffin we do ill be needin to get into that old barn of yours to store it so you go and get it ready and wait for me.
