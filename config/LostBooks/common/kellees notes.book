notes
 
(what looks to be a long shopping list with random thoughts scrawled in the margins. at the bottom seems to be a listing of events, as if someone was trying to write a short timeline)
day 14: towns up, initial shaft sunk thanks to mining sat. deep enough to reach bedrock. good signs of iron. many new faces
day 45: iron almost gone, no more minerals in site. everyones leaving.
day 60: irons gone now, boss said he got a feeling about the place and keeps drilling anyway.
day 68: still nothing. stranger shows up in town, stays in bosses place for hours then leaves.
(scribbled off to the side is a another note) no one saw the man leave?
day 70: foreman gave the crew a day off then drilled a brand new shaft directly into reservoir. town seems to be saved.
