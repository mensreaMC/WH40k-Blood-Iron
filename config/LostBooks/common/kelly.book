momma
 
momma by the time you get this i'll be long gone and i aint sorry cause i told you why i was leavin. you just dont listen and now this is what i gotta do
that priest we came here with aint nothin but a lyin fraud and worse. i know it and daddy knew it to. now that daddys gone you just listen to that priest like he was the Emperor hisself.
if you got a lick a sense youll get out while you can but i know your as stubern as they come so you better just watch that son of a bitch
take care, i love you & watch your back!                   Kelly
