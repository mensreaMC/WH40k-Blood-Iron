Gareths Log
 
I arrived just yesterday, transferred out from Hopefield after Burkes people blew it to hell. No use defending a bunch of bombed out buildings. Place isn't bad, this crew is tight and they know what they're doing.
It's been a few weeks now and I've grown pretty close with these guys. We've been hitting convoys here and there, but we just don't have the firepower to go after any hardened installations.
Finally, after months of raiding we've managed to accumulate enough equipment to start making our own damn ammo. No more risky raids unless we absolutely have to. Command sent a communique to Oz today, he looked angry. Hope it's just Oz being Oz.
