to whoever
 
the last mission was a success. we got in, set the explosives and silenced those guns for good. this valley will never have to worry about Burke's terrorists indiscriminately bombarding them anymore.
now i'm the only one left. gareth, jean, oz and dyson are all dead, gunned down in the line of duty.
now it's just me alone and scared. there's nothing left for me in this world, i think i'll go out in the wastes tonight. i don't plan on coming back. i should have died with my comrades. i can fix that now.
