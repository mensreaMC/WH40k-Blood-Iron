Father Augustus lead us here, away from civilization, to lead a life of quiet contemplation and be free to worship the Emperor as we see fit. I have to admit, I was skeptical of our odds of surviving in this wasteland, but recent events have turned my misgivings around.
Just as our initial stocks began to run dry Father Augustus began receiving shipments of the freshest meats, grains and other wholesome foods. No one knew the Father had any connections or wealth for that matter, but the old priest must have had something stashed away.
On a darker note, we have yet to locate any of the missing pilgrims. At this point many fear they are lost. We should have never let them wander off into the wasteland looking for supplies! If only Father Augustus had the strength of a young man, he could have stopped them.
