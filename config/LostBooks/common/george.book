Lucie,

I'm sorry for everything that's happened. I'm sorry about coming between you and Ricky; I now know how much you love him and understand why we can never be. I hope you two can make it off this shithole of a planet, but I intend to stay.
I'm not going to let Burke make these people into slaves. In truth, I leaked Order 66 to the civilian leaders. It was a dangerous and dumb move but I was afraid there was no other way. I would rather be dead than an accomplice to slavers.
I'm leaving this note to clear the air with you, but I also want to make sure you and Ricky have a chance in getting out of here. Get to the bunker northwest of here near coordinates X.-195 Z.-186 Y.67. The code to the bunker is 5497.
You should be able to get to the space port with the one of the vehicles there. I wish you two luck, and I'll miss you.
George
