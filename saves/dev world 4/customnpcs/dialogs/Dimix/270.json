De relics and texts of this planet are rich in de culture, and so anyone who went explorin' de old places of Mortua lookin' for treasures inevitably came in contact wit dem. Some of us were naturally closer to de truth den others, but dat was what pushed us over. Soon after we started readin' dem texts and filling our homes wit de artifacts we began tinking differently, seeing de world for what it is. At first dare was power in clarity, but den we wanted more. De powers offered us a taste here and dare, and we do de best to spread de word. How often in dis world does a man ask for a miracle from heaven and have his prayers be answered? Now you understand de allure of Chaos to de common person.",
