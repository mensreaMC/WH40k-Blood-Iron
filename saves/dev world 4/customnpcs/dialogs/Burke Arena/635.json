I had the towers powered up, such as they were, for just an instant, and tore a hole in the warp large enough for the entities to spill in, leveling the playing field. They tore through the rebel forces, and saved all of us from defeat at the hands of those traitors. The cost was high, but I knew that once we had consolidated our gains we could use those same towers to drive the entities back.",
