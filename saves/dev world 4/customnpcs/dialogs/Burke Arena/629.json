Despite their petty motivations, the Fabricator and the Governor spoke a sliver of truth: the findings here were too revolutionary for the Ad-Mech to tolerate, and the ponderous Imperial bureaucracy was too slow to prevent them from subverting something so valuable. The only way to ensure the Imperium benefited was to come here myself, so that no Martian traditionalist or preening aristocrat could foul it up for all of us.",
