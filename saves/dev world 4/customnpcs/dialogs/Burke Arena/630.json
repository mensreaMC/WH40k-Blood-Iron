It was there that something came to me - some force or power, I don't know, it had no form, but it spoke to me softly. It told me of ways to save the Imperium from ruin, and above all showed me how to create a sort of Astronomicon of our own, without the need for the Emperor's attention. It showed me many things...but I knew the most effective way to prove myself to Segmentum command, to prove Mortua's potential, was to do just what it suggested: replicate the Astronomicon.",
