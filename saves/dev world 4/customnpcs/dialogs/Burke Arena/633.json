They destroyed everything we had accomplished in the short time we were here, and a self proclaimed \"Revolutionary Council\" threatened to seize control of the planet. They called me a monster, a heretic, a mad-woman. They were fools, and they were whipped into a frenzy by a handful of agitators who had chanced upon some ancient ideology. The words stirred the hearts of their followers like nothing I had ever seen. I began to question if I was wrong, if the Emperor had abandoned me and chosen them instead.",
