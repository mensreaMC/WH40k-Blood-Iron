By constructing a network of those towers across Mortua, we would be able to turn the planet into a beacon in the warp; a lighthouse for every Imperial vessel in the turbulent Segmentum. Construction wasn't easy, though, and the small contingent of tech-priests we brought with us were unable to meet our demand for the more sophisticated equipment. I ultimately decided to empower a more radical faction of the Ad-Mech here on Mortua, and while we were able to meet our demand, civil unrest grew as people questioned our purpose here.",
