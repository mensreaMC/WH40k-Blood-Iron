The people grew restless and began to turn their faith toward leaders that emerged from their own ranks. An opposition began to build in the cities Burke's own bodyguards moved swiftly to brutally put it down. Faction leaders started pushing her harder, and her own officers spoke of madness and dereliction. The foundations of a revolution were being built, and Burke was off constructing towers in the desert.",
