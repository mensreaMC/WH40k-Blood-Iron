I rallied the men under me to head to a fortified base we were familiar with, somewhere we could weather the storm, but we didn't make it. Instead we were forced to take shelter in this ammo dump. It's not even designed for habitation, but it's all we have. Survivors trickled in and we organized scavenging parties to bring back any supplies they could find, and we managed to hold on.",
