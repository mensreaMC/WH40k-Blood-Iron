I do not speak heresy, I speak truth, a truth so dangerous that many men have been killed just to maintain its secrecy. Chaos is real, daemons are real, and the Chaos gods scheme every second of every day to try and bring ruin upon the Imperium, and in fact all of humanity. The gods of Chaos have a vested interest in bloodshed, scheming, disease and debauchery. They send their daemons forth from the warp to act as their agents, but the daemons aren't the only creatures that serve Chaos.",
