-Buy food and water at a questhub. Use Dust, artifacts, gold or silver to make money. Artifacts can be found in randomly spawning dungeons.

-You can get unlimited water at the pump station to the west. Smaller pumps can be found at most settlements.

-You can grow your own food. A beginner quest gives you seeds. There is also a jungle to the west. Go there and hoe grass blocks.

-Flesh can be used to make military rations. Rotten food and organs can be used to make civilian rations.

-Attach a camel pack to your armor to increase the amount of water you can carry.

-Don't jump around to move. Only jump when you have to.",
