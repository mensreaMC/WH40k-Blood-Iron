    "DialogText": "[companions are temporary followers that can be hired to follow you around for X many days and fight mobs for you. there are certain places companions won't follow you, like through teleporters and between levels. in those cases they can be stored in a companion beacon by right clicking on them with it. you can then go through the teleporter and use the companion beacon on the other side. right clicking on the ground with the companion beacon will summon them back, but you will have to hire them again. if you plan to transport a companion use the cheapest hire option to keep from losing money/resources. companions are also guards, and will fight off mobs wherever they are placed, regardless of if they are currently working for you. you can use this to your advantage by stationing them at your base. you can store a companion in a companion beacon indefinitely. try not to pay your companion to stick around if you're going to be teleporting soon]",
