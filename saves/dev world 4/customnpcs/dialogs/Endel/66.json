I had you retrieve samples to confirm what I suspected: something about you pushes the Dust to its limits. Just by being on the planet, you've altered its behavior, setting off a cascading series of events that has made it even more receptive to commands. I don't understand how it works...but what really mystifies me is how someone so powerful could be so ignorant. How could you not know?",
