Most of the wanderlust was inspired by the strange bouquet of convictions that had festered aboard the colony ships. The communities that grew from the religious minorities were insular, strict, and hostile. That's when people really started tossing around the word \"cultists\", and it sure as hell wasn't the Imperial cult they meant. People grew restless, and there were a few skirmishes here and there, but the communities were usually well hidden, and word was that unwanted people tended to disappear. The authorities could have organized some kind of crack down, but tensions on the home front were mounting, and no one in any position of power seemed to care much.",
