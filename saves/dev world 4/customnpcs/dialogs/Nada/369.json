The few that did remain were swallowed up by the heretics, and those that refused to recant their faith in the Emperor and turn to the new, dark gods were killed. They practice their rituals in the open here, and regularly torture and sacrifice slaves, sometimes in the streets. They've erected a temple, even, but I almost never see any of them there. I think they worship by bringing death and pain to others, it's their new sacrament. I wonder sometimes if the Emperor can even see us here, if we can hide from the light. It should have never come to this.",
