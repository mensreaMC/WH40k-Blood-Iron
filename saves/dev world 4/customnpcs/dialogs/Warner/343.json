We stand by our Commander because we understand the value of duty and honor, and regardless of what the traitors say we represent the true Imperium, not them. We still hold the leadership positions, and we hold almost every position within what's left of the military, though many of Burkes close guards have become increasingly reclusive, some refusing to even take off their helmets or speak with their brothers. Truly, though, we are no union. The Dark-mech are cunning bastards, but still bastards, and they only side with us to advance their agenda. The Cultists are animals who should be put down, not pandered to. The only person strong enough to keep us from purging the scum is Burke. As always, we trust in her vision.",
