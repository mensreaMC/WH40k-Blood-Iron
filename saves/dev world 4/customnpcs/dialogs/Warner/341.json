They're unpleasant even compared to the cultists, especially when they start bellowing at you in that shrill, static-tinged, electronic language of theirs. They provide the skilled labor and in a way are the brains of the vault, at least in the technical sense. If you see one then there's a good chance a slave or two is nearby, they are completely dependent on forced labor and seem to really get off on abusing the hell out of them, too, and that's coming from me, a literal slave-master. They all answer to that Seth, so we're probably lucky that Seth is Burkes creature or else I don't know where we'd get our clean water and power. Raiding, maybe?",
